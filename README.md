# appointmentManagementSystem
This project involves the design and implementation plan of a web-based appointment management system for the MYD employees to consume their voucher bonus which can be used at some local small businesses. <br /> <br /> 
The project is aiming to deliver a complete system with basic functionalities that have two user groups -- admin and customer. The system should enable an admin to append new services available for booking, view all the booking requests, and allow a user to record biller information, book a service or cancel a service. The goal of the project is to determine the viability of this system. Potentially, the system may be further developed into a platform that faces the public, includes more local businesses and provides the capability for the user to purchase vouchers, in purposes to encourage people to support local entrepreneurs as well as to bring extra income to MYD.<br /> <br /> 
The project is conducted by a group of students enrolled in SWEN90016 at the University of Melbourne in 2021.The student team has decided to take an Agile Scrum approach in managing the project, with five one-week length sprints, from 19th April to 24th May 2021.<br />
